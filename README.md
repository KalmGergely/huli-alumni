# Gergely Kálmán

Welcome to my page, my name is Gergő and I'm a fresh alumni of Green Fox Academy. During the course, I specialised in in Full Stack Development and this is my progression in our after-course Huli program, where I'm sharpening my existing skills and learning new languages, skills to become an even better candidate.
